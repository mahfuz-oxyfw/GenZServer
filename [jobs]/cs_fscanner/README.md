# Fingerprint Scanner | QB-ESX-Standalone

If you need support I now have a discord available, it helps me keep track of issues and give better support.

```lua Register Scanner to use it as an item: QB Example Below
    ["finger_scanner"] = {
        ["name"] = "finger_scanner",                                                        
        ["label"] = "Finger Scanner",
        ["weight"] = 0,
        ["type"] = "item",
        ["image"] = "finger_scanner.png",
        ["unique"] = false,
        ["useable"] = true,
        ["shouldClose"] = true,
        ["combinable"] = nil,
        ["description"] = ""
    },
```
