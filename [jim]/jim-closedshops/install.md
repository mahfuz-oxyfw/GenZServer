# Usage

This script idea came from wanting to support a business but not being able to buy anything due no one being on duty.
Solution? Backup shop. Help's keep money coming in if no workers are able to turn up.

The items in the config are intended to be items that are crafted, any other items is just a cash cow.

You can add or remove items or jobs easily.

This was intended as an addon for my job scripts but can be used with any RP based job.
It's easy to set up and only installation steps are:

- Install the `closedshops.sql` file to your servers database
- Add or remove any jobs or items you want to use.
- Adjust the prices to the correct amounts (I suggest putting thee price higher than if someone was to sell them in person)
- Enable the jobs you have with going through each job and changing `enable = false` to `enable = true`
- Make sure the spawn locations of the shops NPC's are in a fair location (if doors are locked, don't put them inside?)
- Bosses can only access the closed shop stash through the ped's shop or typing `/closedstock`

		- Changed to update the list of peds that spawn when a player goes on and of duty
		- If this doesn't work for you or causes issues, let me know
	- Removed icons appearing next to the headers of items in favour of support for qb-menu icon support
		- This is more for optimization and tidier code

## v1.3
	- Added percentage reduction of sales money that would go to the society
		- Add a 15% percentage reduction of the sale to be taken to help reduce businesses just letting npcs work for them
		- Business owners can raise the closedshop price (to reduce players refusing to RP for items)
		- This also means business will be at a loss of money if they rely on the closed shops
		- A good middle ground in my opinion
	- Added support for Renewed Scripts qb-businesses
		- Just put your generated item name into the config like all the others and the script should do the rest
	- Added toggle for qb-management and qb-bossmenu
	- Added support for my qb-menu edit
	- QoL optimizaions
		- In your config, you will need to edit the store peds/props to look like `prop_vend_coffe_01` basically remove the quotation marks(") and replace with (`)
	- Added a couple qb-log lines to help track sales

## v1.2
    - Fixed exploit with adding items to stash for free
    - Attempt at optimizing and improving the speed of the duty check loop
        - This was causing a lot of lag issues on bigger population servers
        - Greatly increased check timer from 2 seconds to 5 minutes (300000) this can be changed easily
        - This makes the "Closed Shop" open 5 minutes after everyone is classed as off duty for that job
        - Before it was doing several server checks every 2 seconds, now its one every 5 minutes.
		- This new loop actually speeds up the spawn times of props/peds

## v1.1.1
	- Quick qb-management update
		- Payments now go into society bank account

## v1.1
	- Fixed Stash item check saying out of stock if the first item slot was empty
	- Added ability to add a Prop instead of the NPC
		- You can add different props, most work well, the default qb-target zone be big enough too
		- Different props obviously may not fit and may need their coords moving slightly
		- I've added props to each config table, but to enable you need to comment/remove the "ped" line
		- I've also adjusted a few/most locations so it works better for both ped/props
	- Added support for "Unique" items
		- This makes it so multiple of the same items in different slots are added to the list as one choice with an amount
		- If item is classed as "Unique" the pay menu removes the amount choice and only sell's one at a time. (This stops stacking of a unique item)
	- Added variable to add to Config.Shops "NoLimitStash"
		- This removes the slot limit and set its to a 100 slot stash
		- See an example of this in "CatCafe" Config.Shop Table
