Hi,
thank you for your purchase.
Please don't release my work any longer.

Installation:
1) Insert folder "bzzz_fastfood" to resources folder
2) Add to server.cfg
3) Restart server


--------------------------------------------------
If you stream props in another resource, you must edit the fxmanifest.
Add this line:
data_file 'DLC_ITYP_REQUEST' 'stream/bzzz_food_fastfood_pack.ytyp'

Then the server must be restarted. 
YTYP loads properties of props.
--------------------------------------------------

If you change textures, keep their dimensions as in the original. 
If they have the wrong proportions, they may break in the game.


The lip sync does not work in addon animations (even though it is included in the animation), 
therefore a GTA animation must be triggered for the lip movement. 
An example of how to do this can be found in the 'data' folder. 
In this folder, you will also find instructions for bzzz_usableitems. 
However, if you want to use the animation in dpemotes, rpemotes, and other menus, 
the lips will likely not move, and you will have to script it yourself. 
Unfortunately, I cannot write scripts, so I am not able to help you with this.
